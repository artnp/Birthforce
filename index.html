The individual has to develop the capability of standing on his own and going from dependence to INDEPENDENCE. Once independent, the per- son becomes aware of his potential for A TT AINMENT as an individual-for creating and pioneering when working alone, for leading and managing when working with others.<p> Ex. Martin Luther King (Michael Luther King), born January 15, 1929, with a Life Path of 1. A life devoted to INDEPENDENCE and ATTAINMENT.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b> The subject must learn the benefits of indepen- dence-a two-part learning process. First, the in- dividual must learn to stand on his own two feet, learn not to lean on or depend on others. After the subject is indeed free of dependence, he can .pro- ceed to be a leader or creator. Once others sense the individual's independent capabilities, once he can accept and use his talents, there are likely to be substantial meaningful opportunities. Attain- ment of significant ends-material or otherwise- can follow.<br><b>CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>‚Ä¢ Much inner strength.<br> ‚Ä¢ Leadership capability.<br> ‚Ä¢ Executive and administrative capability-al- ways obvious although sometimes latent in ap- plication.<br> ‚Ä¢ Potential for accomplishment and financial reward-again obvious, although sometimes latent in application.<br> ‚Ä¢ Strong personal needs and desires. Feels it necessary to follow own convictions. Often sur- prised at others' resistance or the consequences of following own convictions .<br> ‚Ä¢ Self-centered. This may be extremely obvious, or may be hidden by a social veneer. The 1 will be very aware of the self-centeredness even if it's not outwardly apparent.<br> ‚Ä¢ The material needs may be large or small-but the 1 will spend the time' necessary to satisfy these needs.<br><b>NEGATIVE EXPRESSION</b><br>A 1 still struggHng with dependence may appear to be available at everyone's beck and call, with few needs of his own. No matter how giving the 1 appears, underneath the giving there will be much dissatisfaction with the dependent side. Often, though, the dissatisfaction may be well hidden. Some l's confuse independence and self-cen- teredness. They may be concerned with their own needs to the virtual exclusion of all else. This type of 1 may very well not know what is meant by self- centeredness or may even justify his self-centered position with a rational argument. In glvmg a reading to a 1 on whom there is no information,it is probably useful to clarify the difference between self-centeredness and independence. Some l's, lacking a sense of balance, may be so dominating and egotistical as to be their own worst enemies. Sometimes thev burst with over- confidence, making them imp~tient with others' advice, unable to listen and benefit from others' opinions.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>Some l's spend most of their lives shaking off their dependent side. If this happens, they have little time left to reap the reward of being indepen- dent. 1's, particularly in the first stages of their life, often find themselves in situations where it is easy to be dependent and difficult to be indepen- dent. It is up to each 1 to struggle through to the second part of the lesson, where attainment can be achieved. An aware 1 operating positively within the basic channel can be growing and experiencing much satisfaction throughout the life. There is much potential for accomplishment, achievement, crea- tivity, and the potential is possible to reach (as compared, for instance, to the difficult-to-attain potential of the 11 or 22). The growing 1 can have a continuing feeling of satisfaction in his progress -and praise from others for his achievements. Often, he can receive good financial compen- sation, can satisfy his material needs, can reach a satisfying position of status."

There are other people all about, and another lesson involves being a meaningful part of a group-a small group like family or friends, a larger group like a business or community. The per- son must learn adaptability, service, consideration for others, i.e., the meaning of a RELATION with others, the idea of COOPERATION.<p>Ex. Henry Kissinger (Heinz Alfred Kissinger), born May 27, 1923, with a Life Path of 2. The quintessence of diplomacy, a master of RELATION and COOPERATION.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b><br>The subject must learn the satisfaction of con- tributing his capability as an organizer and facilitator in group situations. Here, although his contribution is seen, it will rarelv receive full acknowledgement. He must learn that his use of quiet persuasion can accomplish as much as another¬∑s use of force. He must accept that his good ideas will often be better spread by others with more dynamism-that he can be the power behind the throne. If the subject can be comfor- table with others getting credit for his ideas-:- thafs part of the lesson, too. The individual should develop his sensiti\'ity and his skill at working with others to a high !e\"el. The world will be a better place because of his presence. He can glow quietly with the inner satisfaction of a job well done<br><b>CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>‚Ä¢ Sensitive to feelings of others.<br> ‚Ä¢ Cooperative.

Expresses. and receives friend- ship and love.<br> ‚Ä¢ Little concern with material needs or status. Usuallv can den v himself if others can thereb\ benef<br><b>NEGATIVE EXPRESSION</b><br>A 2 sometimes refuses to accept the ri)le he is asked to play. He feels ifs better to be an acknowl- edged leader than part of a group. His leading may be adequate, but is rarely dynamic. Sometimes, in a lead role, he will add confusion rather than har- mony to a situation. He¬∑1I never tmderstand why it happens that way, either. He¬∑s likely to blame others rather than himself. Sometimes the 2, because of too much sensitiv- ity, becomes shy and uncertain and contributes little as a group participant. He may protect his delicate ego by appearing apathetic or indifferent.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>The key to growth and development for a 2 in- volves the control and balance of his sensitivity. He must find the path where he is not so sensitive that his feelings are constantly being hurt. His sensi- tivity to others must be so finely attuned that he can be a friend, lover or diplomat in the highest sense of these concepts. It is too easy for the 2, trying his wings, to retreat with pain from situations where others are insentitive to him. He must learn how to deal with others¬∑ insensitivities without being overwhelmed. A 2 operating in the right channel experiences a great deal of pleasure in life. He is the recipient of much love and affection from others."

The JOY OF LIVING can be expressed with optimism and enthusiasm. There can be a purity, even a naivete here. (This is, perhaps, the most enjoyable lesson of all the numbers.)<p>Ex. Boris Pasternak (Boris Leonidovich Pasternak), born February 10, 1890, with a Life Path of 3. The Nobel Prize winner, who made the most of EXPRESSION.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b><br>The subject must learn the joy of expressing himself. If he can be open, warm and full of delight, he is likely to be admired by others and desired as a pleasant companion. An easy lesson? In many ways the easiest and most delightful lesson: the experience of pure joy and the expres- sion of that joy for others to share. It is the begin- ning of an appreciation of the beauty that can be in the world. The individual should become aware of his spe-cial talents. He probably has a good imagination and artistic abilities to be developed. He can excel in creative work-painting, sculpting, music, per- haps. Most likely his creativity will be seen where verbal ability is important-in writing, acting or similar endeavors. He can express the beauty he experiences in his artistic work. His capability at creative self-expression is the highest level of at- tainment in this lesson.<br><b>CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>‚Ä¢ Warm and friendly.<br> ‚Ä¢ Ver\' social. A weicome addition to any social situ~tion. Knows how to make others' feel at home.<br> ‚Ä¢ Good conversationalist.

The 3 rec- ognizes the possibilities but may not be moved to develop the creativity.<br><b>NEGATIVE EXPRESSION</b><br>A 3 may be so delighted with the joy of living that his life becomes frivolous and superficial. He may scatter his abilities. and express little sense of purpose. When, on the other hand, he has difficulty developing his given capabilities, he may retre~t into himself. He may feel uncomfortable in social situations, may prefer to hide his feelings rather than express them. He may appear moody or taci- turn. If he is hurt by others, he may be critical or demeani<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>When a 3 is operating within the basic path, his approach to life is likely to be exceedingly positive, his disposition sunny. He seems to deal with prob- lems with more ease than others. The 3's open disposition accepts the existence of problems, yet deals with them without being dragged to the depths of despair. Even while working through difficulties, the 3 will usually express warmth and friendliness. When he expresses his problems op- enly, he can often deal with them seriously but without rancor. The 3 may mature later than others. His frivol- ity or moodiness may be difficult to shake. The frivolous 3 is often a delight, but is seen as a dilet- tante and treated as such. The moody 3 appears as an enigma because the cause of the moodiness is often not clear. The 3 is on a special lighter track, quite different from the other numbers. He may be able to get little help from others in learning to express his positive potential."

Life doesn't always appear expansive or yours for the taking. Often, it feels just the opposite. The individual must learn the difficult law of LIMITATION. Everyone has limita- tions-limitations presented by the environment, by the physical body, by the restrictions of the individual's view- points. Rather than struggle against these limits, it is necessary to learn to live with them, to accept them and to make a meaningful existence, not in spite of the limitations, but be- cause of the limitations. It is a difficult lesson. The individual embarking on this course must learn system and organization, ORDER on. a practical level. He must be prepared to be of SERVICE to others.<p>Ex. Sigmund Freud, born May 6, 1856, with a Life Path of 4. The father of psychoanalysis, his contribution consisted of us- ing ORDER and SERVICE.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b><br>The subject must learn the advantage of order and system in accomplishing his work. He must also learn the rewards of service. He'll probably be involved in practical, down-to-earth work. Hav-ing determined where his duty lies, he must pro-ceed with the hard work at hand, patiently and dependably. The subject must learn to live with the law of limitation. He will be aware of limitations in his life-limitations of the environment, of his own physical body, of his individual viewpoint. Often, the subject may feel that circumstances limit him more than they limit others. He must learn how to live not in spite of the limitations, but in harmony with the limitations. He must learn to accept the restrictions rather than struggle with them. His life can then develop on a deep and beautiful path.<br><b>CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>‚Ä¢ Practical.<br> ‚Ä¢ Capable of systematizing and managing. produce order where little existed.<br> ‚Ä¢ Capable of systematizing and managing.

He will feel tied down and frustrated. Often the limitations stem from his own stubborn, obstinate manner and his rigid ap-proach, but he will be hard-pressed to see that he is causing his own problems. Sometimes, his concen-tration on details to the exclusio'n of the bigger pic-ture limits his potential. His frustration sometimes expresses in bossiness and dominance. Occasionally, the 4 will express his dissatisfac-tion with his Life Path by going in the opposite direction. He will be disorganized and irrespon-sible, with little sense of time and virtually no ac-countability to others. The chaos he creates around him will further upset him, but he will not be able to see himself as the cause.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>This is a difficult lesson for many people. Few individuals want to learn to live with limitations. The usual reaction is to fight the restrictions rather than to accept them. All 4's feel the sense of limitation. Only when they recognize the positive values inherent in limitation will their lives become growing and vital. The acceptance of limitation is the beginning of overcoming limitation as a negative part of the life. Limitation is also often in the eye of the beholder. What feels limiting to a 4 may not look limiting to an outside observer."

With the freedom that this abundance of talent and opportunity brings, life can be exciting. But the lesson is more difficult: the indi- vidual must learn the CONSTRUCTIVE use of FREEDOM. The individual must not waste his many talents or misuse his on- going opportunities; he must not get lost in solely physical desires-food, sex, alcohol, drugs. He must not scatter his potential and end up with frustration. He must make a mean- ingful existence by using freedom productively.<p>Ex.

Getting on track is often difficult, usually takes up a good portion of the life. 5's often enjoy freedom with little understanding of the construc~tive use of freedom. With so much talent and ver-satility, with so many opportunities from which to choose, it's difficult to be concerned about con-structive vs. nonconstructive. Sometimes, many years will pass before the 5 will look back, realize how little has been accomplished with such an advantage in opportunities and abilities. When the rolling stone changes to a more positive expression of change, uncertainty and opportunity, the growth of the individual can be a joy to behold."

Along with the balancing, the lesson of RESPONSIBILITY can be a meaningful one. The individual may find himself responsi- ble for more than what rightly seems his share. Others will recognize his,stre.pg,th, 'and he may be expected to help them if they are in need and cannot help themselves. He will probably be the one who holds the family together, who harmonizes and adjusts difficult situations. He may choose to limit himself to his family, his friends, possibly the close community. The friendship and LOVE the individual expresses to others will come back to him from those he helps. He can bask in the glory of a job well done and the quiet reward of friendship and love returned. The individual's capability at harmony and balance may also be expressed creatively-there is the possibility of artistic achievement.<p>Ex. Dwight Eisenhower (David Dwight Eisenhower), born Octo- ber 14, 1890, with a Life Path of 6. He handled the Allied forces in World War II with BALANCE and RESPONSIBILITY.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b><br>The subject must learn the deep pleasure ofThe subject must learn the deep pleasure of handling responsibility. He is born with the innate ability to give help and comfort whenever needed, to support those too weak to support themselves. Others will quickly recognize these capabilities and come to the 6 for help. He'll find himself responsible for far more than his fair share. He must accept the responsibility and learn to serve family, relatives and friends. He must be willing to give out much in the way of friendship and love, and will receive much friendship and love in return. The individual must always be there to help, sometimes even to his own disadvantage. He may have to learn to distinguish between helping and interfering. The subject will usually seek the closeness of marriage, although he may have to work at the balance needed in marriage far more than he might expect. His ability to balance and harmo-nize may express in creative activities-art, music, writing-providing him with much pleasure.<br><b>CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>‚Ä¢ Responsible.

Some-times a person accepts and is overwhelmed by re-sponsibility, and becomes a near-slave or doormat for others. This negative 6 will feel unhappy but will usually feel that this is his role in life. Occasionally, the individual confuses responsi-bility for a situation with dominating a situation. Occasionally, too, the negative 6 is far too exacting (of himself and others), extremely critical and fussy at the same time. The rare 6 who abdicates responsibility will feel tense and uneasy, always realizing he is not accep-ting the share that belongs to him. He may be laden with guilt and have difficulty continuing satisfactory relations with others.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>The 6 usually accepts responsibility so readily that advantage may be taken of him without his ever being aware of it. At some period in his life, the 6 will probably get tired of the burden, may stop to clarify just how much responsibility he chooses to assume. When he examines his life situa-tion, he will find that many do come to him be-cause they are too weak to take care of themselves. He will find others, though, who lean on him out of force of habit-others who are capable of being responsible for themselves. He will do well to weed out those who need him from those who don¬∑t. Part of the lesson of responsibility is clarifying when and where the sense of responsibility is to be used. 6's are very exacting of themselves. Often, they're willing to sacrifice themselves (or their families) for the welfare of others. They may have to learn to temper their dreams of perfection. Sometimes, they have to learn to express their own individuality despite the heavy burden of responsi-bility they carry."

There will be much time spent alone-the person must learn to be alone and not feel isolated. Often, the individual will appear different to others-his way of thinking or doing may be very much his own and may seem inexplicable to his fellow man. He must accept that he is on a different wavelength and find satisfaction in that. In a world where materialism rates so highly, the road for the counselor, the professor, the pure re- searcher may be a difficult one.<p>Ex.

His lack of contact with others will make it difficult for him to grow and develop.

The in- dividual will work for MATERIAL SATISFACTION. This may mean emphasis on money to buy the best in houses, cars, furnishings, trips. (Perhaps, if he can reach the highest level of -this lesson, he will see that material freedom can mean relying very little on money or material matters. Few ever gain this insight.) The individual will be very conscious of status in relation to material things and will work to satisfy his need for status to prove his superiority.

Striving for power and high material goals may make him aware of the limitations of his ability or the restrictions of his circumstances.<p>Ex.

Sometimes, the negative 8, although desirous of money and achievement, will be afraid to take the risks involved in asserting himself.

He may have difficulty seeing the forest instead of the trees. He may be so immersed in his attainment of money, material possessions, status and power, that he may not see that these are not ends in themselves-only the means to the ends. The goal, quite simply, is the satisfaction that can come with material freedom and power. All too often, this lesson is lost or confused. If the material freedom, once achieved, does not provide pleasure, the 8 has not mastered the lesson. If the power, once achieved, is misused, the 8 is off the track.

The leader of India's independence drive was immersed in ideas of SELFLESSNESS and HUMANITARIANISM.<br><b>CENTRAL FOCUS</b><br>The subject must learn the beauty of giving of himself for the deep satisfaction of giving-with- out thought of reward or return. A simple lesson in theory, a very difficult one in practice. The indi- vidual must practice selflessness, giving up a!llbi- tions and material possessions of his own for the common good. His innate love of his fellow man must be expressed with purity, from humanitarian interests alone. He must give love, help or under- standing when needed, again with no thought of receiving anything in return. The difficulty on this path is, of course, the lack of return. The subject's pleasure comes in the giving. If he looks for more, if he has ulterior motives, the path will be difficult and there will be little reward or satisfaction. The subject may give to others as a fine spouse, lover or friend, as a teacher or helper. He may give to others in terms of creative endeavor.

Sometimes, the negative 9 may be aware of the satisfaction of the humanitarian impulse, but will spend his time in dreaming or in going off in all directions at once. He will accomplish little and be dissatisfied.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>9's can achieve as much as anybody in terms of status, recognition, receipt of love and friendship. But they receive the good things of life in a satisfy- ing way primarily as they express their own self- lessness and awareness of others. This can be a very difficult lesson. You have to head in what seems like the opposite direction to get where you're go- ing. The 9 often rebels at the idea. It's difficult for him to conceive that he can be immensely satisfied as soon as he has given up the idea of needing per- sonal satisfaction. He can find all the love and .friendship he wants as soon as he stops looking for love and friendship for himself and gives out love and friendship to others instead.

In his life, he must inspire by his own example, living in the way revealed to him, spreading his ILLUMINATION for others to absorb and¬∑ benefit. This number is as difficult as it is rewarding. Often, particularly at an early age, the individual is aware of his special powers yet unable to synthesize them for his own use or for the good of his fellow man. He is often a relatively im- practical idealist, far more a dreamer than a doer. There is an undercurrent of nervous tension always present from the high power sources to which the individual is attuned. He has to learn to live with his special powers, to set himself aside from the world of material accumulation in order to better under- stand the powerful forces which can reveal a higher guidance.<p>Ex. Peter Hurkos (Peter Van Der Hurk), born May 21,1911, with a Life Path of 11.

With this master number, he has added perceptions, added awarenesses, differ-ent capabilities of understanding. These percep-tions and capabilities take much effort to develop but, once developed, the individual is capable of far more ability and attainment than most others. The 11 must learn to trust and develop his own in-tuition to tune in to forces beyond. He would do well to involve himself with psychic or occult stu-dies.

An occasional negative 11 gets lost in his dreams, accomplishes little, and rationalizes his predicament to try to find satisfaction.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>11 is special. He is capable of great accomplish-ments, although he will rarely reach anywhere near his potential. He may not even understand anything of discussions of the spiritual world. He may, instead, be operating on an intuitive level, so that his relation with any but the material world is not particularly clear to him. 11 's special awarenesses are often difficult to handle. He can see the huge power potential that is present, but may be unable to focus the power to put it to practical use. The accompanying nervous tension can make him difficult to live with. He is so aware and sensitive that ordinary living may provoke all sorts of pressures which others never feel. It usually takes an 11 a long time to get on the track. While he is searching for direction, he will be, quite probably, a difficult person to deal with. It is hard to sit on the powder keg of such power and be comfortable, and the discomfort is ex-pressed by attacks of nerves or temper.

He may accomplish little, feel frightened by the world around him, uncom- fortable with his nervous tension.<br><b>COMMENTARY</b><br>You will look for a long time before you find a 22 accomplishing anything even vaguely close to his potential. Mostly, the 22 is in process, trying to handle the forces which feel too powerful to han- dle, trying to live with the tension which accom- panies these forces. The latent power of the 22 will be obvious to all. People may shake their heads and wonder why he didn't do more with his potent energies.

The first master number, the 11, must work to develop intuition, to tune into psychic forces not available to those with lower numbers. He must stand ready to be a channel with a message from above. In his life, he must inspire by his own example, living in the way revealed to him, spreading his ILLUMINATION for others to absorb and¬∑ benefit. This number is as difficult as it is rewarding. Often, particularly at an early age, the individual is aware of his special powers yet unable to synthesize them for his own use or for the good of his fellow man. He is often a relatively im- practical idealist, far more a dreamer than a doer. There is an undercurrent of nervous tension always present from the high power sources to which the individual is attuned. He has to learn to live with his special powers, to set himself aside from the world of material accumulation in order to better under- stand the powerful forces which can reveal a higher guidance.<br><b>MOTIVES</b><br>The subject would like to manifest his view on spiritual matters, to share his ideas of idealism, beauty and perfection. He wants to give of himself to humanity. He is often more concerned with the abstraction of giving to the world rather than specifically giving to individuals.<br><b>POSITIVE ATTITUDES</b><br>‚Ä¢ Utopian dreamer.<br> ‚Ä¢ Idealistic, intuitive and inspirational.<br> ‚Ä¢ Religious and spiritual, possibly psychic ability.<br> ‚Ä¢ Much inner strength and devotion to a chosen cause, sticks to his ideals.<br> ‚Ä¢ Good mind.<br><b>NEGATIVE ATTITUDES</b><br>‚Ä¢ Nervous tension brought on by high level awareness.<br> ‚Ä¢ Too sensitive.
